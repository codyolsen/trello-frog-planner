# Trello Frog Planner
This is a script that interfaces with a trello board to create a short and long term task/goal planner. The cards will leap-frog based on their due date and list position each night.

TODOS:
  - Make this readme
    - Explain system and include diagram
  - Add initialization script for setting up trello from scratch
  - Add nightly task with cron or other scheduler
